\section*{Abstract}
\label{ch:eng-abstract}
With the number of IoT devices increasing in the world different ways of communication has emerged. Two of these (MQTT and CoAP) have become really prominent. The problem with different communication standards is that sometimes different systems need to communicate with one another. This project aims to build an end to end system where the main data provider is a CoAP-server and the consumer uses an MQTT-client. The report results in a functioning system where a user application built using Flutter can show real-time data from a Raspberry Pi running a CoAP-server. Round trip time was measured to evaluate the system, and it was concluded that the project was a success but with such powerful devices a pure MQTT implementation would have been a better solution.
