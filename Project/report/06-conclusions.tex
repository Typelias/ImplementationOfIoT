\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implementation}
A complete system was implemented with working communication from a MQTT client in a user application to a CoAP-server running. There is one bug in the system that I have not found a solution for. Sometimes the Dart version of the MQTT-client sends a connect-message with identity 0 which is a reserved message ID. As I have not created it was hard to find the cause for this bug and I was not able to create a successful workaround. Luckily this does not happen often.

Another problem was that I was not able to fully utilize Flutters multi-platform support. The MQTT Dart library does support all platforms, but it requires different client objects for web applications. Dart does provide a check if the application is running on the web but including the package for the web version of the MQTT-client also adds a package that is not supported by the other platforms thus breaking the application for other platforms. 

By using Go for building everything is set up for concurrency, but I did not utilize it fully. Both the CoAP-server and the translator could be multithreaded using Go's concurrency features. This could theoretically decrease the latency.


\subsection{Results}


% The conclusion/discussion (choose a heading) is a separate chapter in which the results are analysed and critically assessed. At this point your own conclusions, your subjective view, and explanations of the results are presented.

% If this chapter is extensive it can be divided up into more chapters or sub-chapters i.e. one analysis or discussion chapter with explanations of and critical assessment of the results, a concluding chapter where the most important results and well supported conclusions are discussed and to sum it up a chapter with suggestions for further research in the same area. In this chapter it is of vital importance that a connection back to the aim of the survey is made and thus the purpose is pointed out in a summary and analysis of the results. 

% In this chapter you should also include answers to the following questions: What is the project's news value and its most vital contribution to the research or technology development? Have the project's goals been achieved? Has the task been accomplished? What is the answer to the opening problem formula? Was the result as expected? Are the conclusions general, or do they only apply during certain conditions? Discuss the importance of the choice of method and model for the results. Have new questions arisen due to the result?

% The last question invites the possibility to offer proposals to others relevant research, i.e. proposal points for measures and recommendations, points for continued research or development for those wishing to build upon your work. In technical reports on behalf of companies, the recommended solution to a problem is presented at this stage and it is possible to offer a consequence analysis of the solution from both a technical and layman perspective, for example regarding environment, economy and changed work procedures. The chapter then contains recommended measures and proposals for further development or research, and thus to function as a basis for decision-making for the employer or client.

\subsection{Ethical and Societal Discussion}
\label{ch:concl:ethical}
% You will need to include a discussion on ethics, societal impact, and considerations.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{ch:concl:future-work}
% You should also explain potential future work based on your work.
